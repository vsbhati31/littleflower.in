    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Little Flower Preschool was founded with a heartfelt mission — to create a place where children are not just educated, but celebrated for who they are. From our humble beginnings to becoming one of the most trusted preschools in Silvassa, our journey has always been rooted in love, care, and excellence. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We understand that the early years are the most critical in a child’s life. That’s why we’ve built a nurturing space where little learners feel safe to explore, confident to ask questions, and inspired to dream big. Every corner of our school is thoughtfully designed to stimulate curiosity, encourage creativity, and cultivate a lifelong love for learning.
